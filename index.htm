        <h3>Urban-Rural Population</h3>
        <div class="first"></div>
        <p>Until the 1980s, both Indonesia's urban and rural populations increased gradually, with the rural
            population far outnumbering the urban. After 40 years of strong growth, urban population reached the
            majority for the first time in 2011, preceded and followed by a minor but continuous decline in the
            rural population. This tendency is expected to continue in the next decades. It uses line chart to visualize
            the trend.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Urban Aglomerations and Cities with the Largest Population</h3>
        <div class="second"></div>
        <p>Indonesia has several large and rapidly growing cities, including Jakarta (the capital), Surabaya,
            Bandung, and Medan. This part tells the trend of the top 10 growing cities of Indonesia as the target of
            urbanization. In this part, I will employ choropleth map to visualize the top ten cities with largest
            population.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Global Urban Growth Compared to Indonesia</h3>
        <div class="third"></div>
        <p>More than 4 billion people, more than half of the world, live in urban areas. The UN has estimated this
            milestone
            event, when the number of people in urban areas overtook the number in rural settings, occurred in 2007.
            This part will use two stacked bar charts to visualize the trend of urban vs rural population in percentage
            and the comparison with Indonesia trend.
